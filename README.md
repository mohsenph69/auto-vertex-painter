Youtube Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgl3EnQCU0A

After activating this plugin, Each time you select a MeshInstance3d with a Mesh a `V Paint` button will apear in toolbar, and if you click on that you can change the vertex color uniformly or you can interpolate between **Color A** and **Color B** base on their position or normal

**Please Note** after changing the vertex color of your mesh a new mesh will be created so if you saved the original mesh in resource directory it will be not changed until you save the new mesh on that, OR you can keep the Original mesh too
